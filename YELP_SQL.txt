Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table =  10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review =10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo =10000
viii. Tip = 537
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years =2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	The city chosen is Las Vegas and the category is Food.
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

	Yes , they do have different distribution of hours.
	In the 2-3 star business group, only 3 star business is obtained for the city Las Vegas 
	The 3 star businesses work more than 12 hours while the 5 stars work for around 10 hours or less.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	The 4-5 star busineses have the most reviews .Between 4-5 star businesses, the 5 star businesses have fewer review counts compared to that of 4 star businesses.
	The 2-3 star businesses have fewer reviews compared to the 4-5 star business.Between 2 and 3 star businesses, the 3 star businesses have more review counts compared to that of 4 star businesses.

         
        
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	The 3 star business is primarily located in the postal code 89109 of Las Vegas
	The 5 star businesses are primarily located in the postal code 89121 of Las Vegas

SQL code used for analysis:

	--Grouping business by city:

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The number of open 2-3 star businesses is less compared to that of 4-5 star business.Many of the former is closed compared to the latter
         
         
ii. Difference 2: Westside has equal number of closed and open 2-3 business shops.While this is not the case for 4-5 star business,they are mainly open at the postal code 89121 while the location of the closed shops is unkknown.

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
        Analysis on the review based on category
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

            From the yelp dataset, the tables business, category, review are used. The three tables are joined using the business id.
			The objective is to analyse the businesses by grouping them based on category and analysing the star ratings and the reviews.
			There are three types of review tones which are useful,funny and cool.
			The Analysis answers the following questions:
				i)which category has most reviews ?
				ii)what kind of reviews?
				iii)Which star business is that?
				iv) Which location does the business belong to?
			This data is chosen to understand the popularity of each category and to check if the star rating really matter for it to be popular.
			This analysis also let us know which categories need improvement in terms of business and grabbing its audience.
		
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
